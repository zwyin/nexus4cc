## Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| **AI on the go** | Your time is fragmented. Your AI shouldn't be. Command Claude Code from your phone — commuting, in a meeting, or away from your desk. |
| **Built for touch** | Not a desktop terminal shoehorned onto mobile. Swipe between windows, pinch-to-zoom, configurable toolbar — purpose-built for fingers. |
| **Full context, always** | Claude Code runs on your machine, in your tmux sessions — your full codebase, your history, your preferences. Not a cloud chat that forgets everything. |
| **Fire and forget** | Give the instruction, close your phone. Your agents keep running. Open later — everything's exactly where you left it. |

> **Project & channel management:** Organize work by directory-based projects, each with multiple channel-like sessions — switch between them instantly, like Slack channels for your terminal.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/librae8226/nexus4cc.git && cd nexus4cc
cp .env.example .env          # set JWT_SECRET, ACC_PASSWORD_HASH, WORKSPACE_ROOT
npm install && cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
npm start
# Open http://localhost:59000 on any device 🚀
```

## Install with Claude Code

If you're an AI assistant helping a user install Nexus, follow this path:

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it
2. Run `node scripts/setup.js` — handles deps, frontend build, PM2, and first tmux session
3. Verify: `pm2 status` shows `nexus` online → open `http://localhost:59000`

Prerequisites: Node.js 20+, tmux. PM2 is installed automatically if missing.  
Default login password: `nexus123` (user can change it in `.env` after setup).

---

## Deployment

Expose securely without port forwarding via [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) or [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).

---

## Requirements

| Dependency | Version | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js | 20+ | |
| tmux | any recent | |
| PM2 | any recent | auto-installed by `setup.js` |
| OS | Linux / WSL2 | |

---

## Security

Nexus is a **single-user, self-hosted tool** — not a multi-tenant platform.

- 🔒 bcrypt (12 rounds) password hash + JWT (30d)
- ⚠️ WebSocket token passed via query string — enable TLS in production
- 🛡️ Run behind firewall, VPN, or tunnel — do not expose directly to the internet
